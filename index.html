      <h1>Thirsty Orange 2017 Lineup</h1>
      <h3> Thai Fighter <span class="label label-danger"> <span class="fa fa-bomb"></span> Hot </span></h3>
      <p> A favorite at Oktoberfest and Thirsty Orange. We start off with a simple pale ale base with Motueka and Pacific Jade hops from New Zealand. After that, things get weird. We age this beer on powdered peanut, toasted coconut, Thai basil, and Thai
        chiles. Yeah, chiles. It's spicy. This strange brew works surprisingly well, and usually pours quick, so make it an early stop!</p>
      <p> <strong>ABV: </strong> 7% <strong>IBU: </strong> 50 <strong>SRM: </strong> 7</p>

      <h3> Impeachment Ale <span class="label label-success">New Brew</span></h3>
      <p> Impeachment Ale is a clean, bright, simple blonde ale that we loaded down with several pounds of peaches. It's light, it's fruity, it's the kind of beer you want to drink 6 of after mowing the yard.</p>
      <p> <strong>ABV: </strong> 4.8% <strong>IBU: </strong> 32 <strong>SRM: </strong> 3.8</p>

      <h3> Take the Black IPA</h3>
      <p> The beer that won 1st place in the Iron Brewer competition in 2015. Take the Black is a roasty black-as-midnight IPA hopped with a classic combo of Centennial and Cascade, and a secret extra bitter herb. Take the black with us and see if you can figure out what it is!</p>
      <p> <strong>ABV: </strong> 7.5% <strong>IBU: </strong> 62 <strong>SRM: </strong> 36</p>

      <h3> Black Lodge Imperial Porter</h3>
      <p> A brew to make the Bookhouse Boys proud. Pitch black, roasty, malty, and this time we took it a step further and oaked it. Its complex intertwining flavors will have you wanting more, but don't drink too much--you may find yourself sitting next to the Man From Another Place.</p>
      <p> <strong>ABV: </strong> 8% <strong>IBU: </strong> 52 <strong>SRM: </strong> 51</p>
      
      <h3> Muro de Fuego Mexican Lager <span class="label label-success">New Brew</span> <span class="label label-danger"> <span class="fa fa-bomb"></span> Hot </span></h3>
      <p> We decided to try our hand at the popular Mexican lager style. You know, it's that $2.50 32oz mug you drink at your favorite taqueria on Tuesday night, but with an Elderbrew twist. We aged this little guy on cacao nibs and chipotles. Be forewarned, this one will come at your tongue like a wall of flames!</p>
      <p> <strong>ABV: </strong> 8% <strong>IBU: </strong> 52 <strong>SRM: </strong> 51</p>
