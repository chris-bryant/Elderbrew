    <h1>The Owls Are Not What They Seem</h1>
    <h4>Brett Saison with EKG, Amarillo, and Grains of Paradise</h4>
    <div class="brews">
      <p>
        We are delighted to present our first collaboration ever, with the inimitable Depot Street Brewing.
        Owls is a farmhouse Brett saison with complexity stacked into every part of it. Tart, malty, even
        a little hoppy for its style, spicy, estery. At 6.6%, you can (and will) drink the whole 750ml bottle
        on your own! Each bottle was hand corked and caged by your ol' pals at Elderbrew and Depot Street.
        Available for $12 per bottle, or for a limited time, you can get our custom and highly limited glassware
        and a bottle for $20! Don't wait. Neither the glasses nor the beer will last long!

    <h3>On Tap</h3>
    <div class="brews">
      <h4>Barry Can't Hang <span>- 4% Lager, 35 IBU</span></h4>
      <h4>
        <strong>Music City</strong> - Nashville, TN
      </h4>
      <p>
        A simple, crisp, clean lager. Germans love it. This one is for you, Barry.
      </p>
      <h4>Amra <span>- 6.5% Mango IPA, 55 IBU</span></h4>
      <h4>
        <strong>Destihl</strong> - Bloomington, IL
      </h4>
      <p>
        'Amra' (Sanskrit for Mango) intertwines the citrusy hop characters of a west coast-style IPA with the fruitiness of juicy mangos, resulting in an elaborate and psychedelic tapestry of flavors that were absolutely destined for each other in this beer.
      </p>
      <h4>Dirty Heads Vacation <span>- 5% Fruit Lager, N/A IBU</span></h4>
      <h4>
        <strong>Four Sons</strong> - Huntington Beach, CA
      </h4>
      <p>
        Fruit. Lager. It's crisp and refreshing, and it's gonna be a hot one, so you want it.
      </p>
      <h4>Brown Sugga Brown Cow <span>- 6.9% Mocha Brown Ale, 15 IBU</span></h4>
      <h4>
        <strong>D9</strong> - Cornelius, NC
      </h4>
      <p>
        Not to be denied, D9 presents a rare departure from their tried and true sours in this brown ale with a touch of mocha.
      </p>
      <h4>New Heights IPA <span>- 6.9% IPA, 101 IBU</span></h4>
      <h4>
        <strong>New Heights</strong> - Nashville, TN
      </h4>
      <p>
        One of our new favorites out of Nashville, New Heights provides a hefty 6.9% IPA which we'd like to call a "midwest IPA." Somewhere between West Coast hoppy and New England juicy, if you're looking for any sort of IPA, this one is a winner. It doesn't need a cute name. It's just good.
      </p>
      <h4>Trash Panda <span>- 6.2% Smores Sour, N/A/ IBU</span></h4>
      <h4>
        <strong>D9</strong> - Cornelius, NC
      </h4>
      <p>
        On the nose, it's 100% smores. In your mouth, it's a straight up sour.
      </p>
      <h4>Blackberry Cider <span>- 5.0% Cider *gluten free*, N/A IBU</span></h4>
      <h4>
        <strong>Crown Valley</strong> - St. Genevieve, MO
      </h4>
      <p>
        Straightforward tart blackberry cider. With no glutens!
      </p>
      <h4>Sly Rye <span>- 5.7% Porter, N/A IBU</span></h4>
      <h4>
        <strong>Yazoo</strong> - Nashville, TN
      </h4>
      <p>
        Another Nashville darling Yazoo provides us this tasty rye porter, coming in at a very drinkable 5.7%.
