    <h3>Current Signature Brews</h3>
    <div class="brews">
      <h4>Black Lodge Imperial Porter <span>- 6.9% American Porter, 50 IBU</span></h4>
      <p>
        Black as midnight on a moonless night! This dark, roasty, smooth porter would do Agent Cooper proud.
        Slight hop bitterness and aroma, but dominated by coffee and chocolate notes. Be careful - too many sips could transport you
        in the Black Lodge.
      </p>
      <h4>Thai Fighter <span>- 6.3% Specialty Ale, 49 IBU</span></h4>
      <p>
        This award-winning recipe is inspired by the flavors and ingredients of Thai food. We transform a pale ale with toasted coconut,
        peanut flour, and locally-grown Thai chilis. You read that right, this beer is a bit on the caliente side.
        If you brave the heat, you will be rewarded by a delicious mingling of interesting ingredients you won't normally
        find in a beer!
      </p>
      <h4>Halfling IPA <span>- 4.9% India Pale Ale, 53 IBU</span></h4>
      <p>
        Hopped with the power combo of Columbus, Cascade, Citra, and Amarillo. An attractive golden hue, a citrusy
        aroma, a solid malty backbone, and the low gravity would keep any halfling coming back for another round.
      </p>
      <h4>Dalcassian <span>- 4.8% Irish Red Ale, 21 IBU</span></h4>
      <p>
        A no-frills Irish Red brewed in honor of the Gaelic Irish tribe of the same name. Malty, slightly hoppy, refreshing. And red.
