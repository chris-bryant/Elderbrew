    <h4>Brett Saison with EKG, Amarillo, and Grains of Paradise</h4>
    <div class="brews">
      <p>
        We are delighted to present our first collaboration ever, with the inimitable Depot Street Brewing.
        Owls is a farmhouse Brett saison with complexity stacked into every part of it. Tart, malty, even
        a little hoppy for its style, spicy, estery. At 6.6%, you can (and will) drink the whole 750ml bottle
        on your own! Each bottle was hand corked and caged by your ol' pals at Elderbrew and Depot Street.
        Available for $12 per bottle, or for a limited time, you can get our custom and highly limited glassware
        and a bottle for $20! Don't wait. Neither the glasses nor the beer will last long!
